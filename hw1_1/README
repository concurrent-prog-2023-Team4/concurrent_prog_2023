Readme file for HW1 exercise 1
------------------------------
There is a Makefile included that compiles all the files using -fsanatize=address, to the Makefile:
-make clean
-make

In order to run the executable type ./hw1_1_final <num_of_threads> and redirect the input file (input.txt) from stdin
ex: ./hw1_1_final 4 < input.txt

For testing, we use the file input.txt, which contains ~3700 characters
The program outputs two files named .copy and .copy2, which should be copies of input.txt
Run "diff input.txt .copy2" and "diff .copy .copy2" to ensure there are no differences!
