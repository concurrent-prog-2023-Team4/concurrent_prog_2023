Readme file for HW3 exercise 2
------------------------------
There is a Makefile included that compiles all the files using -fsanatize=address:
-make clean
-make

In order to run the executable type ./hw3_2 <num_of_threads> and redirect one of the 2 input files (input.txt, primes.txt) from stdin.
ex: ./hw3_2 8 < tests/primes.txt
All tests are located in folder tests

For testing, we use 2 files: input.txt that contains 500 random positive numbers and primes.txt that contains ~14500 positive random numbers,
the last number of both files is negative to make the program stop. 

The program prints the result of each number on file out.txt in order to be easy to proccess it (./hw3_2 <num_threads> < tests/<filename>).
ex: ./hw3_2 9 < tests/input.txt
