Readme file for HW1 exercise 2
------------------------------
In order to compile hw1_2.c file:
-> gcc -Wall -g hw1_2.c -o hw1_2 -lpthread -fsanitize=address

In order to run the executable type ./hw1_2 <num_of_threads> and redirect one of the 2 input files (input.txt, primes.txt) from stdin.
ex: ./hw1_2 8 < primes.txt

For testing, we use 2 files: input.txt that contains 500 random positive numbers and primes.txt that contains ~7500 positive random numbers,
the last number of both files is negative to make the program stop. 

The program prints each number and if it is prime or not, and we suggest redirecting the stdout in a file.
ex: ./hw1_2 9 < input.txt > results.txt
