Readme file for HW4 exercise 2
------------------------------
The 2nd assignment consists of a custom library for thread creation using coroutines. It also implements semaphore functionality to ensure proper syncronization.

The file "mythread_lib.c" includes the implementation of coroutines also used in assignment 1 and a scheduler for automated context switching. 

There's no executable bundled with this assignment, as the functionality is tested through the code of the 3rd assignment.
