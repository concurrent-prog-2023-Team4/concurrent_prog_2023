Readme file for HW1 exercise 3
------------------------------
In order to compile hw1_3.c file:
-> gcc -Wall -g hw1_3.c -o hw1_3 -lpthread -fsanitize=address

In order to run the executable type "./hw1_3" and add the input file (input.txt) as argument:
-> ./hw1_3 <input.txt> 

The input.txt file that is used for testing contains 1200 random integer numbers.

The program prints the sorted array in stdout, so we recommend redirecting it to a file.
