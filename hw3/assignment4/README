Readme file for HW2 exercise 4
------------------------------
There is a Makefile included that compiles all the files using -fsanatize=address:
-make clean
-make

For testing we use 2 files (in folder /tests) that create different scenarios of passengers arriving at the train at different time. 
The files contain how many seconds later each passenger arrives at the train.

The program prints messages for when a passenger arrives, when the passenger gets on and off of the train and when the train ride starts and stops.

In order to inform train to stop, in all tests the last number should be negative, and the program will create a passenger with the absolute
value of it and then will inform train to stop.

To run the program you need to give as arguments a test file and the max number of passengers that can be on the train each ride ( ./hw2_3 tests/<filename> <max_passengers> ).
ex: ./hw2_4 tests/input.txt 3
